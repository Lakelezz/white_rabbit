# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to get involved, may it be a pull request, suggestion,
bug report, or a textual improvement! : )

## Contributions

Contributions to `white_rabbit` should be done via pull requests.
Issues display development-plans or required brainstorming, feel free to ask,
suggest, and discuss!
The `master`-branch contains the latest release.

## Pull Request Checklist

- If a pull request breaks the current API, use the `breaking-changes`-branch,
otherwise `stable-changes`.

- Commits shall be as small as possible, compile, and pass all tests.

- Make sure your code is formatted with `rustfmt`.

- If you fixed a bug, add a test for that bug. Unit-Tests belong inside same
file's `mod` named `tests`, integrational tests belong inside the `tests`-folder.

- Last but not least, make sure your planned pull request merges cleanly,
if it does not, rebase your changes.

If you have any questions left, ask in a related issue or open a new one! : )
